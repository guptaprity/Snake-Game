# Snake-Game
Built Snake_Game using Raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using any external libraries.
The Game
The rules of the game are as follows:

   - The user controls a 'snake' around a game area (the 'board')
   - The snake is in continuous motion (up, down, left, or right) and the user can change its direction using the arrow keys
   - The snake has to eat an apple which is randomly placed on the board
   - When the snake eats the apple:
       - The user's score is increased
       - The snake's length is increased
       - The snake's speed is increased
       - A new apple is placed randomly on the board
   - If the snake hits the edge of the board, or its own tail, the game is over


High Score Table

In order to add a bit of healthy competition to the game, a high score table system is implemented. When the game is over (due to wall or tail collision) the user is prompted to enter their name and submit an entry to the high score table. The high score table should then be shown to the user.
